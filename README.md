Certainly! Here is the complete README file code that you can copy and paste into your repository:

# React Native Project

This is a new React Native project, bootstrapped using [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Getting Started

**Note:** Make sure that the Python files are in a separate folder since they are for the backend/API code.

**Note:** Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

**For Android:**

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

**For iOS:**

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Step 3: Modifying Your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open `App.jsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

**For Android:** Press the `R` key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (`Ctrl + M` (on Windows and Linux) or `Cmd âŒ˜ + M` (on macOS)) to see your changes!

**For iOS:** Hit `Cmd âŒ˜ + R` in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³

## Packages to be Installed

Make sure you have installed the following packages in your project:

- [`react-native-webrtc`](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc):

  ```bash
  npm i react-native-webrtc
  ```

- [`react-native-linear-gradient`](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient):

  ```bash
  npm i react-native-linear-gradient
  ```

- Consult the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) webpage to install it in your project.
